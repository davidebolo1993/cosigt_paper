# SVs

Structural variant regions for benchmarking.

## Files

- `svs_refined.hgsvcv3.bed` - Refined SV-containing gene regions after COSIGT refine step

## Description

Gene regions containing structural variants identified and refined using COSIGT's refinement process. Unlike CMRGs (adapted from Locityper), this SV region set is newly defined for this study and further detailed in the manuscript.

**Format**: BED file with 4 columns (chromosome, start, end, gene name)
