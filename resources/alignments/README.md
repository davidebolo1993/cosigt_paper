# Alignments

1000 Genomes Project sample lists used for alignment-based benchmarking.

## Files

- `1000G.hgsvcv3.txt` - Sample alignment URLs for 1000G samples matching HGSVCv3 assemblies
- `1000G.hprcy1.txt` - Sample alignment URLs for 1000G samples matching HPRCy1 assemblies

Each file contains FTP URLs to CRAM files from the 1000 Genomes Project hosted at EBI.

## Usage

These samples were used for leave-zero-out and leave-all-out experiments. Reads were realigned to a different linear reference as detailed in the manuscript methods.
