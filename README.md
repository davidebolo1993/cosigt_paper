Done:
	- cluster by default
	- add clusters in output


Next steps:

	
	- simulate simple-to-complex events over paths in a graph (sim n individuals, 2 paths each - diploid - with various events)
	- simulate short-reads (modern) - maybe also ancient? - and long-reads for those individuals
	- genotype using graph made from synthetic haplotypes
	- real data (start with what? full graph -> index -> extract -> re-build locally for the time being). But this has drawbacks in the sense that some fragmented paths may end in the final graph - see hprcv1?)
	- ONT resequencing of 1000 Genomes.
